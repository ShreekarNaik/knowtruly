Setup these pages in the frontend/ folder

If you are using build tooling use vite or if not then fine, if you are doing package management and all use pnpm
One more thing if you are thinking of using tailwindcss make sure that you set it up first and test it if it is working or not in a very simple way before you start building the actual pages, as tailwindcss v4 has a lot of drastic changes in terms of how it is setup in the project you can refer the official tailwindcss docs for that https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite for that and also make sure you have tested this as i said previously.
hey also when using the ports make sure you kill the previous process you had created and then use it or just at the start just start the dev server once and you can use the same running localhost port for everything without rerunning since it has live update.
